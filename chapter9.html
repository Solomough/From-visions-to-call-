      <h3>Living in Divine Purpose</h3><p>### *Living in Divine Purpose*<br><br>From my childhood visions to the present day, I have experienced countless similar divine encounters that have shaped my understanding of God's heart and His plans for humanity. Each vision, each prophetic word, each supernatural experience has been a stepping stone on the excellent path He predestined for my life.<br><br>Since February 4, 2025, when the prophetic word first awakened my calling, God has proven Himself faithful beyond measure. His consistency and reliability have become the bedrock of my confidence as I navigate this divine assignment.<br><br>The truth I proclaim to you with absolute certainty is this: **Call on Him and you will be saved.** This is not religious rhetoric but a tested reality. He has been directing my steps daily, revealing His will with increasing clarity, and empowering me to walk in the supernatural as a normal way of life.<br><br>Since embracing this calling, my existence has become characterized by one direction only—upward and forward. There are no backwards steps, no regression, no defeat. Each day brings fresh revelation, deeper intimacy with God, and greater demonstration of His power through ordinary vessels yielded to His extraordinary purposes.<br><br>This is why I extend this invitation to you: **Join me as we represent and officiate His will here on earth until His imminent return.**<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I declare to you from personal experience—this is the best life to live. It is a divine call to walk in righteousness, excellence, perfection, and the abundance of riches that belong to every child of God.<br><br>There is no other life better than this life which Christ gave to us freely. When you discover your divine purpose and align your steps with His predestined path, every day becomes an adventure in faith, every prayer becomes a demonstration of power, and every breath becomes an opportunity to represent heaven on earth.<br><br>The choice is before you. The window of salvation remains open. The ark is ready to receive all who will come.<br><br>But remember His urgent words: **"There is no time."**<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter8.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='epilogue.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
