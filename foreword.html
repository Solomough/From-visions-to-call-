      <p>This is not merely a collection of dreams or imaginative tales. These are the authentic spiritual encounters and divine visions that have shaped my life from childhood to the present day. Each vision came with profound clarity, unmistakable peace, and lasting impact that continues to guide my steps.<br><br>From a seven-year-old child witnessing fire from heaven to a young adult receiving direct mandates from the Almighty, this journey chronicles how God reveals His plans to those who seek Him with sincere hearts. May these testimonies encourage you in your own spiritual walk and draw you closer to the One who speaks to His children in dreams and visions.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='index.html'>⬅ Table of Contents</a><span></span><a href='introduction.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
