      <h3>Age 16 - The Rapture Vision</h3><p>### *Age 16 - The Rapture Vision*<br><br>Nine years later, at age sixteen, the Lord granted me another powerful vision that would test my faith and deepen my commitment to righteousness.<br><br>I found myself in a beautiful seaside location, sharing spiritual messages with those gathered around me. The atmosphere was peaceful as I dove beneath the crystal-clear waters, enjoying the serenity of this coastal paradise.<br><br>Suddenly, everything changed. As I lifted my eyes toward the heavens, I witnessed the sky beginning to open—not merely parting, but gradually fading away like a curtain being drawn back to reveal eternity itself.<br><br>Terror gripped my heart as I realized what was happening: this was the rapture I had anticipated for so long. But instead of joy, I felt overwhelming fear because my feet remained firmly planted on the ground. I was not being lifted up with the saints.<br><br>"This is impossible!" I cried out in desperation. "I'm supposed to be taken too!" In my panic, I began jumping frantically, hoping somehow to help myself ascend to meet the Lord in the air.<br><br>The vision was so vivid, so real, that I began to weep bitterly. The thought that tormented me most was how I could have preached to so many people about the rapture, yet find myself left behind when it actually occurred.<br><br>Through my tears, I pleaded with God until suddenly I awakened from this intense spiritual experience. Instead of despair, gratitude flooded my heart. "Lord, thank You for this opportunity," I prayed with renewed conviction. "I will never joke with my salvation again."<br><br>This vision served as a divine wake-up call, reminding me that spiritual preparation requires more than knowledge—it demands a life of genuine holiness and readiness.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter2.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter4.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
