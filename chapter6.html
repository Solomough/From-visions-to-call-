      <h3>The Genesis Revelation</h3><p>### *The Genesis Revelation*<br><br>During this same season of intense spiritual activity, the Lord led me to one of the most profound revelations I have ever received. He directed my attention to Genesis 6:6, 14, and 16, passages that initially seemed like a mystery but would soon unveil His divine instruction for these last days.<br><br>As I meditated on these scriptures, the connection became clear. Just as God instructed Noah to build an ark for the preservation of life, He was now commissioning me with a similar mandate for our generation.<br><br>The Lord's voice came with unmistakable authority: "Make for Me an ark, which is Christ's riches in glory. It should have three decks, and the essence is to tell and bring them into the riches of Christ. Most importantly, proclaim the acceptable year of God, for as it was in the times of Noah, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be."<br><br>This revelation birthed what I now understand as "The Ark~Christ Riches in Glory"—a spiritual vessel designed to rescue souls in these final days. The foundation of this mandate rests upon two key scriptures: Genesis 6 (God's command to Noah) and Ephesians 3:16 (the riches of Christ's glory).<br><br>Just as Noah's ark had three decks to accommodate different creatures, this spiritual ark has three levels of ministry:<br>- **First Deck**: Introducing people to Christ and His salvation<br>- **Second Deck**: Teaching believers about their inheritance in Christ  <br>- **Third Deck**: Proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord's return<br><br>The urgency of Noah's day mirrors our current season. As judgment approached in Noah's time, so the coming of the Son of Man draws near in ours. The ark is not merely a metaphor—it is a divine strategy for soul-winning and spiritual preparation in these last days.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter5.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter7.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
