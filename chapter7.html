      <h3>April-June 2025 - The Ark Vision</h3><p>### *April-June 2025 - The Ark Vision*<br><br>Between April and June 2025, as I lay on my bed in prayer, the Lord granted me yet another extraordinary vision that would further clarify my understanding of the divine ark He had commissioned me to build.<br><br>Once again, I found myself supernaturally elevated above ground level, surveying the spiritual realm with enhanced perception. Before me appeared an enormous ark—not the wooden vessel of Noah's time, but a magnificent spiritual structure that radiated divine glory.<br><br>As I observed this heavenly ark carefully, I noticed something crucial: every door and window was sealed shut except for one single opening. Curious about this detail, I inquired of the Lord, pointing toward the solitary open window.<br><br>His response sent shockwaves through my spirit: "That is the window of salvation. There is no time—bring people into it!"<br><br>The profound symbolism was unmistakable. Just as Noah's ark had only one door through which all creation entered to escape the flood, Christ is the only door to salvation in our generation. The closed windows and doors represented the limitation of access—salvation comes through Christ alone.<br><br>Yet the urgency in God's voice could not be ignored. "There is no time" echoed through my spirit with the same intensity as His previous warnings. This was not a casual invitation but an emergency evacuation. Just as the flood was imminent in Noah's day, so the end of this age approaches rapidly.<br><br>This vision solidified my understanding that the ministry of "The Ark~Christ Riches in Glory" is not merely about teaching—it is about rescue. Every soul brought into this spiritual ark through the window of salvation is another life preserved for eternity.<br><br>The countdown has begun, and the window remains open. But for how much longer?<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter6.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter8.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
