      <h3>Age 7 - The First Divine Encounter</h3><p>### *Age 7 - The First Divine Encounter*<br><br>At the tender age of seven, as I lay peacefully on my bed, the Lord granted me my first profound vision. In an instant, I found myself elevated high above the earth, surveying the world below with supernatural clarity.<br><br>The scene was both magnificent and terrifying. My eyes beheld wonders beyond description, but what captured my attention was the great fire that descended from the heavens. This divine flame struck a mountain with tremendous force, shattering rocks and causing widespread destruction across the landscape.<br><br>All around me, people fled in terror, running frantically to find shelter from this heavenly manifestation. Yet I remained perfectly calm, filled with an unexplainable peace that surpassed all understanding. While others panicked, I found myself genuinely puzzled by their fear, asking those around me, "Why are you running?"<br><br>The most significant detail of this vision was what I carried in my hands—the Holy Bible, the Word of God. Even as chaos erupted around me, I held firm to Scripture, protected by its divine power and truth.<br><br>When I awakened from this supernatural encounter, my young mind struggled to comprehend its meaning. Yet deep within my spirit, I knew I had witnessed something profound—a glimpse into the divine realm that would shape my understanding of God's power and presence for years to come.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='introduction.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter2.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
