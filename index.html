        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>From the earliest moments of my life, I have been marked by divine encountersâ€”visions that carried weight, dreams that whispered truth, and revelations that pointed toward destiny. *From Visions to Call* is not just a title; it is a testimony. It reflects a journey of spiritual awakening, personal surrender, and the embrace of divine purpose.<br><br>This book is a collection of life-altering momentsâ€”visions that shaped my walk with God and revealed the urgency of His call. These are not stories meant to entertain, but encounters meant to stir, awaken, and guide. Within these pages, I share the raw, unfiltered experiences of a soul in pursuit of heaven's agenda.<br><br>At the heart of this journey is a visionâ€”a mandate:<br><br>*"Embracing divine purpose, I illuminate the path to great success and spiritual growth. As a vessel for God's wisdom, I share insights and expertise to empower individuals on their journey through life. With a passion for serving and guiding, I invite you to explore the transformative power of faith and knowledge."*<br><br>You may be reading this as someone hungry for direction, struggling with calling, or questioning your experiences. Let this book be a mirror and a map. A mirror that reflects God's dealings with you, and a map that points you toward purpose.<br><br>In a world clouded with distractions, uncertainty, and compromise, it has become more vital than ever to discern the voice of God, walk in obedience, and prepare for what is to come. My hope is that as you read, you'll begin to recognize the divine hand upon your life tooâ€”and that you'll step boldly into your calling.<br><br>This is not just my storyâ€”it's an invitation to discover yours.<br><br>Welcome to the journey. Welcome to the call.<br></p>
