      <h3>March-April 2025 - Psalm 16:6</h3><p>### *March-April 2025 - The Psalm 16:6 Revelation*<br><br>During the months of March and April 2025, I dedicated specific time to intercede for certain individuals the Lord had placed on my heart. Little did I know that these prayer sessions would yield one of the most significant visions of my spiritual journey.<br><br>As I prayed with increasing intensity, I began to notice something extraordinary developing before me—a wall. This barrier started small but grew progressively taller as my prayers continued, eventually reaching such heights that I could no longer see what lay on the other side.<br><br>Undeterred, I closed my eyes tightly and pressed deeper into prayer. In that moment of concentrated intercession, the Holy Spirit spoke clearly to my heart, directing me to Psalm 16:6: "The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yes, I have a good inheritance."<br><br>After reading this passage, I closed my Bible and returned to prayer. Suddenly, the impossible happened—the towering wall began to create an opening, parting down the middle as if responding to divine command.<br><br>As this miraculous separation occurred, the Lord's voice thundered in my spirit with urgent clarity: "The lines have fallen unto you in pleasant places. Now drag them to your side at very great speed—there is no time!"<br><br>This vision revealed God's heart for souls and His desire to see people brought into His kingdom inheritance. The wall represented the barriers between the lost and salvation, while its supernatural parting demonstrated God's power to break down every obstacle when His people pray with faith and persistence.<br><br>The urgency in God's voice continues to echo in my spirit, reminding me daily that time is short and the harvest is great.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter4.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter6.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
