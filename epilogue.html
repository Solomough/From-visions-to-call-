      <p>As I conclude this testimony of divine encounters and supernatural experiences, my heart overflows with gratitude for what God has done, is doing, and will continue to do through those who yield themselves completely to His purposes.<br><br>These visions were not given for my benefit alone, but as a clarion call to this generation. The fire from heaven still burns, the sky continues to open, the walls still part before persistent prayer, and angels still encamp around those who fear the Lord.<br><br>May this book serve as both encouragement and warning- encouragement that God still speaks to His children in visions, and  warning that time is rapidly running out for humanity to respond to His call.<br><br>The Ark is built. The window is open. The angels are ready.<br><br>What will be your response?<br><br>"For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay."-Habakkuk 2:3.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter9.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='about.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
