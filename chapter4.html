      <h3>February 4, 2025 - The Divine Calling</h3><p>### *February 4, 2025 - The Divine Calling*<br><br>On the fourth day of February 2025, the trajectory of my spiritual journey changed forever. The word of God came to me through His servant, Prophet Terna Joshua Ivue, delivered with such divine force that it penetrated the depths of my soul.<br><br>That evening, carrying a heavy heart burdened by the weight of this prophetic word, I knelt in my room to seek God's forgiveness. The moment my knees touched the floor, a clear voice spoke to my spirit: "Pick up a pen and a book."<br><br>Without hesitation, I obeyed. What followed was unlike any experience I had ever encountered. As I began to pray in the Holy Spirit, my hand moved across the pages, writing with supernatural speed and clarity. The words flowed not from my mind but from the very heart of God.<br><br>I had never written in this manner before. The experience was both humbling and exhilarating as heaven touched earth through the simple act of putting pen to paper.<br><br>That remarkable evening marked the moment when all my previous visions suddenly made perfect sense. The childhood encounters, the teenage revelations, the years of wondering—everything aligned as God revealed my divine responsibility with crystal clarity.<br><br>Embracing this calling with my whole heart, I opened myself completely to the Spirit of God. From that day forward, He began to work mighty exploits through me, demonstrating His power and presence in ways that continue to amaze all who witness them.<br><br>As I write these words, I can testify with absolute certainty: He is as real as the eyes that read this testimony.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter3.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter5.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
