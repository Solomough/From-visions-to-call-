      <h3>July 2025 - The Two Beings</h3><p>### *July 2025 - The Two Beings*<br><br>The month of July 2025 brought perhaps the most intimate supernatural encounter I had experienced to that point. As I lay on my bed engaged in evening prayer, the atmosphere in my room suddenly shifted dramatically.<br><br>Through my spiritual senses, I perceived the presence of two towering beings entering through my door. They positioned themselves beside my bed, looking down at me with what I could only describe as watchful care. Though my physical eyes remained closed, my spirit saw them clearly—majestic, powerful, and unmistakably angelic.<br><br>Curiosity almost overcame me as I felt the urge to open my physical eyes to confirm what my spirit was witnessing. But before I could act, a gentle voice cautioned, "Don't."<br><br>It was then that the Holy Spirit began to minister to me with tender correction: "Don't you know those two beings are always with and around you? It's because you don't notice, and you are not conscious of what I told you."<br><br>His words triggered a powerful memory from earlier in the year. Between March and April, during one of my prayer sessions, He had spoken these words: "The Angel of the fountain of waters is with you and working with you." In my spiritual busyness, I had received this word but failed to maintain consciousness of its reality.<br><br>As this remembrance flooded my mind, the atmosphere in the room transformed completely. Waves of brilliant light began pulsating around me—growing brighter, then dimming, then brightening again in a rhythm that seemed synchronized with heaven itself.<br><br>The intensity was so overwhelming that I instinctively turned my face away when the light blazed, only to look back as it dimmed. This cycle continued as the Holy Spirit continued His instruction.<br><br>"That is how it's supposed to always be," He explained patiently. "That's how it has been—you just don't have that consciousness. Anytime you pray, know that this is the kind of atmosphere you create."<br><br>Each wave of light brought with it an indescribable peace mixed with holy fire that burned within my chest. It was an excellent moment—a glimpse into the reality that surrounds every believer who truly walks in divine purpose.<br><br>From that transformative evening, the Holy Spirit instructed me to maintain constant consciousness of these angelic companions. I learned that the supernatural is not occasional—it is the normal Christian life when we develop the spiritual awareness to perceive what God has already established around us.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter7.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter9.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
