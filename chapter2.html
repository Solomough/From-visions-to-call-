      <h3>Childhood Faith and Preparation</h3><p>### *Childhood Faith and Preparation*<br><br>Following that first vision, an unshakeable consciousness settled upon my young heart. I possessed an inner knowing that required no further study or human explanation—a divine confidence that the rapture of the church would occur before 2020, or certainly not far beyond that time.<br><br>This revelation birthed within me a holy determination. I resolved that I would be fully equipped and spiritually prepared for Christ's return before 2020 arrived. This was not mere childhood fancy; it was a solemn commitment that governed my daily decisions.<br><br>I remember countless afternoons with my beloved grandmother, gazing up at the moving clouds with anticipation. "Grandma," I would ask earnestly, "look how the skies are moving! Is this the rapture about to happen?"<br><br>Her gentle affirmation—"Yes, my son"—would immediately send me into fervent prayer. I would cry out for God's forgiveness, making sincere resolutions to abandon every sinful habit. "I will never insult anyone again," I would promise, along with pledges to forsake all the wrongdoing I perceived in my young life.<br><br>Remarkably, all of these profound spiritual encounters and commitments occurred before my tenth birthday. Even as a child, the reality of eternity burned brightly in my heart, shaping my character and preparing me for the greater revelations that lay ahead.<br></p><div class='chapter-nav'><a href='chapter1.html'>⬅ Previous</a><span></span><a href='chapter3.html'>Next ➡</a></div>
